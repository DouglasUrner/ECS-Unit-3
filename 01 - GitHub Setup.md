# GitHub Setup

You made it this far, congratulations!

## After completing this assignment you should know how to:

1. Establish an account on GitHub and modify your profile.
2. Search on GitHub to find other users and repositories.
3. Create repositories on GitHub.
4. Add files and edit files through the web interface on GitHub.
5. Commit changes to files on GitHub.
6. Be starting to appreciate the importance of paying attention to details and accurately following instructions.

## There are two assessments:

Excellent technical skill.

1. Creating a GitHub account: I will be looking for an account that I can easily and clearly identify with you in my list of followers.
2. Set up a website using GitHub Pages: I will be looking for a working site at _your-account-name.github.io_. The site doesn't need to be fancy, but it does need to respond.

## Things to do:

1. If you haven't done it already follow me. You do this by clicking on my name in the upper left hand corner of the page – that will take you to my main page on GitHub and there will be a green follow button there.
2. Work through the [Hello World guide](http://guides.github.com), this will give you an overview of the process of working with GitHub. The big things to understand are:
  * Details and accuracy _really_ matter, practice following directions __exactly__ as they are written.
  * Repositories and how to create them.
  * How to add files to a repository.
  * How to edit files and save your changes.
3. Set up your website starting with [these instructions](http://pages.github.com). Once you get to the part where they want to know what system you are on you're kind of stuck – they don't provide instructions for creating the page online. So pick up with the instructions below.
4. If you haven't verified your e-mail address, you will need to do this. Thanks to Justin for pointing this out. Your site will not be visible until you have a verified e-mail address.
 
## Editing your site using the online editor at GitHub

After creating the repository:

1. Add a file named _index.html_.
2. Click on the pencil icon on the right hand side to enable editing the file.
3. Start simple and test the site - just "Hello, world!" will do it.
4. Commit your changes.
5. Go visit your site!

Note that the first time you commit a change is when the site is actually created and that can take a long time. After the first change updates are almost instant.
