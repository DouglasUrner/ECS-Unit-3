HTML File Structure
===================

Or, steal this file

Stealing, or perhaps more politely, reusing, code is a time honored and valuable tradition is CS. When you reuse code you save yourself both the time to type in the code, but more importantly you save the time to design and debug the code. Reuse of code also encourages you to think about consistancy and creating reusuable code – all good habits for a software developer.
